    \title Module archiver
    \brief Provides support for building archives.

    The \c archiver module contains the properties and rules for creating (compressed) archives.
    The output artifact has the file tag "archiver.archive". The sole input artifact is a text file
    containing the list of files to package, with one file path per line. The paths can be
    relative, in which case they will be looked for at \c{archiver.workingDirectory}. The file tag
    of this input artifact is "archiver.input-list".

            Possible values are \c undefined, "0", "1", "3", "5", "7" and "9". Higher numbers
            result in a smaller archive, but the compressing process will take more time.
            A value of \c undefined means to use the default compression level.
